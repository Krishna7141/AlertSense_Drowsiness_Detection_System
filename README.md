# 🛑 AlertSense: Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time computer vision system built to detect drowsiness and alertness in individuals using webcam input. This project uses facial and eye landmark detection to monitor eye closure and trigger alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected — an important safety measure especially for drivers and heavy machine operators.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishna7141/AlertSense_Drowsiness_Detection_System.git
cd AlertSense_Drowsiness_Detection_System

2. **Install Required Packages:**

pip install opencv-python numpy

3. **Run the Notebook:**

Open DrowsinessDetection&Alertness.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run all cells.

💡 You’ll need a webcam for live detection.

🧪 Future Enhancements

🔊 Integrate voice alarms or mobile notifications

🧠 Train a CNN model for higher eye-state detection accuracy

📱 Build a mobile/web interface with Streamlit or Flask
